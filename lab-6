  * Parallel Analysis Program For Raw Data and Data Permutations. 
 
* To run this program you need to first specify the data 
  for analysis and then RUN, all at once, the commands 
  from the MATRIX statement to the END MATRIX statement. 
 
* This program conducts parallel analyses on data files in which 
  the rows of the data matrix are cases/individuals and the 
  columns are variables;  Data are read/entered into the program 
  using the GET command (see the GET command below);  The GET 
  command reads an SPSS data file, which can be either the 
  current, active SPSS data file or a previously saved data file; 
  A valid filename/location must be specified on the GET command; 
  A subset of variables for the analyses can be specified by using 
  the "/ VAR =" subcommand with the GET statement;  There can be 
  no missing values. 
 
* You must also specify: 
  -- the # of parallel data sets for the analyses; 
  -- the desired percentile of the distribution and random 
     data eigenvalues; 
  -- whether principal components analyses or principal axis/common 
     factor analysis are to be conducted, and 
  -- whether normally distributed random data generation or 
     permutations of the raw data set are to be used in the 
     parallel analyses. 
 
* Permutations of the raw data set can be time consuming; 
  Each parallel data set is based on column-wise random shufflings 
  of the values in the raw data matrix using Castellan's (1992, 
  BRMIC, 24, 72-77) algorithm; The distributions of the original 
  raw variables are exactly preserved in the shuffled versions used 
  in the parallel analyses; Permutations of the raw data set are 
  thus highly accurate and most relevant, especially in cases where 
  the raw data are not normally distributed or when they do not meet 
  the assumption of multivariate normality (see Longman & Holden, 
  1992, BRMIC, 24, 493, for a Fortran version); If you would 
  like to go this route, it is perhaps best to (1) first run a 
  normally distributed random data generation parallel analysis to 
  familiarize yourself with the program and to get a ballpark 
  reference point for the number of factors/components; 
  (2) then run a permutations of the raw data parallel analysis 
  using a small number of datasets (e.g., 100), just to see how long 
  the program takes to run; then (3) run a permutations of the raw 
  data parallel analysis using the number of parallel data sets that 
  you would like use for your final analyses; 1000 datasets are 
  usually sufficient, although more datasets should be used if 
  there are close calls. 
 
 
* These next commands generate artificial raw data 
  (500 cases) that can be used for a trial-run of 
  the program, instead of using your own raw data; 
  Just select and run this whole file; However, make sure to 
  delete the artificial data commands before attempting to 
  run your own data.
